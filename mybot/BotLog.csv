what is a variable?,Data types specify how we enter data into our programs and what type of data we enter. Data type determines the type of data a variable will hold. If a variable x is declared as int. it means x can hold only integer values. Every variable which is used in the program must be declared as what data-type it is.

How do you declare a variable ?,"<img src=""https://www.atnyla.com/library/images-tutorials/int-data-type-in-java-2a.PNG"" width=""500"" height=""600"">"
example of declaring a variable,"int a, where 'int' is a datatype and 'a' is a variable."
example of initialising a variable,"{'In c programming language, variable can be initialized in the declaration statement of any block (either it may main’s block or any other function’s block). While declaring a variable you can provide a value to the variable with assignment operator. Here is the syntax of the variable initialization datatype variablename=value. For example': 'int x = 50, y = 3'}"
