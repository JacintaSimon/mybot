- - I want to talk about Variables and Constants.
  - Variable is used to store the value. As name indicates its value can be changed or also it can be reused many times.  A Constant is a value that is fixed throughout the program. This means constants are those variables which value is not changed throughout the program.
- - I want to talk about For Loops.
  - A "For" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code (statements) a known number of times. The for-loop statement is a very specialized while loop, which increases the readability of a program. Here is the syntax of the of for loop. <img src="https://www.w3resource.com/w3r_images/c-for-statement.png">

- - Example of a variable
  - int a, where 'int' is a datatype and 'a' is a variable.
- - What is a datatype?
  - Data types specify how we enter data into our programs and what type of data we enter. Data type determines the type of data a variable will hold. If a variable x is declared as int. it means x can hold only integer values. Every variable which is used in the program must be declared as what data-type it is.

- - syntax for initialising a variable
  - In c programming language, variable can be initialized in the declaration statement of any block (either it may main’s block or any other function’s block). While declaring a variable you can provide a value to the variable with assignment operator. Here is the syntax of the variable initialization datatype variablename=value. For example: 'int x = 50, y = 3'
